        This project was made in collaboration with Alaa Alkhaled for the
        Fundamentals of Graphic Design Course. We worked on the branding of a
        Gin Company during October 2022 using tools from the Adobe Creative
        Cloud. <br / > <br / >
        <!-- <p class="companyinfo"> -->
        Born in 2007, White Moose Gin is distilled in the heart of the forest,
        in the city of Sundsval in the north of Sweden. The White Moose company
        started to make something more than just a drink, the whole experience
        with its subtle notes to the feelings it brings. The company is a
        representation of the Swedish forest, by sharing the love for nature and
        wildlife with other people by using the art of distillation to create a
        dreamy gin with a mouth-watering flavor of juniper berries.
